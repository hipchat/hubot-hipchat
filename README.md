# hubot-hipchat

## Quickstart: Hubot for HipChat on Heroku

This is a HipChat-specific version of the more general [instructions in the Hubot wiki](https://github.com/github/hubot/wiki/Deploying-Hubot-onto-Heroku).

1. Create a [new HipChat account](https://www.hipchat.com/help/page/how-do-i-invite-other-users/) for your bot to use. Stay signed in to the account - we'll need to access its account settings later. We'll assume the bot's name is "Hubot Botson" in these instructions.
1. Download the latest Hubot archive from https://github.com/github/hubot/downloads
1. Extract it
1. Edit `hubot/packages.json` and add `hubot-hipchat` to the `dependencies` section. It should look something like this:

        "dependencies": {
          "hubot-hipchat": ">= 1.0.9",
          "hubot": ">= 2.3.0",
          ...
        }

1. Edit `Procfile` and change it to use the `hipchat` adapter. If your bot's first name is not "Hubot" you'll want to edit the name here as well:

        app: bin/hubot -a hipchat -n Hubot

1. Turn your `hubot` directory into a git repository:

        % cd hubot/
        % git init
        % git add .
        % git commit -m "Initial commit"

1. Install the [Heroku command line tools](http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-command) if you don't have them installed yet.
1. Create a new Heroku application and (optionally) rename it:

        % heroku create --stack cedar
        % heroku rename our-company-hubot

1. Note: If you're going to include the redis-brain.coffee plugin you'll need to add [Redis To Go](http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/redistogo).

        % heroku addons:add redistogo

1. Configure it:

      You will need to set a configuration variable if you are hosting on the free Heroku plan.

        % heroku config:add HEROKU_URL=http://soothing-mists-4567.herokuapp.com

      Where the URL is your Heroku app's URL.

      Set the JID to the "Jabber ID" shown on your bot's [XMPP/Jabber account settings](https://www.hipchat.com/account/xmpp):

        % heroku config:add HUBOT_HIPCHAT_JID="..."

      Set the name to match the "Room nickname" value on the same page:

        % heroku config:add HUBOT_HIPCHAT_NAME="..."

      Set the password to the password chosen when you created the bot's account.

        % heroku config:add HUBOT_HIPCHAT_PASSWORD="..."

1. Deploy and start the bot:

        % git push heroku master
        % heroku ps:scale app=1

      This will tell Heroku to run 1 of the `app` process type which is described in the `Procfile`.

      If you're running an adapter that changes the `app` to `web` you need need to run the following instead of the above command.

        % heroku ps:scale web=1


1. You should see the bot join all rooms it has access to. If not, check the output of `heroku logs`. You can also use `heroku config` to check the config vars and `heroku restart` to restart the bot. `heroku ps` will show you its current process state.

1. Assuming your bot's name is "Hubot", the bot will respond to commands like "@hubot help". It will also respond in 1-1 chat ("@hubot" must be omitted there, so just use "help" for example).

1. To configure the commands the bot responds to, you'll need to edit the `hubot-scripts.json` file ([valid script names here](https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/tree/master/src/scripts)) or add scripts to the `scripts/` directory.

1. To deploy an updated version of the bot, simply commit your changes and run `git push heroku master` again.

Bonus: Add a notification hook to Heroku so a notification is sent to a room whenever the bot is updated: https://www.hipchat.com/help/page/heroku-integration

## Adapter configuration

This adapter uses the following environment variables:

### HUBOT\_HIPCHAT\_JID

This is your bot's Jabber ID which can be found in your [XMPP/Jabber account settings](https://www.hipchat.com/account/xmpp). It will look something like `123_456@chat.hipchat.com`

### HUBOT\_HIPCHAT\_NAME

This is the full name exactly as you see it on the HipChat account for your bot. For example, "Hubot Botson". It must match the name set on the HipChat account or it will be unable to join rooms.

### HUBOT\_HIPCHAT\_PASSWORD

This is the password for your bot's HipChat account.

### HUBOT\_HIPCHAT\_ROOMS

Optional. This is a comma separated list of room JIDs that you want your bot to join. You can leave this blank or set it to "@All" to have your bot join every room. Room JIDs look like "123_development@conf.hipchat.com" and can be found in the [XMPP/Jabber account settings](https://www.hipchat.com/account/xmpp) - just add "@conf.hipchat.com" to the end of the room's "XMPP/Jabber Name".

### HUBOT\_HIPCHAT\_DEBUG

Optional. Set to true to enable some additional debug logging.

### HUBOT\_HIPCHAT\_HOST

Optional. Use to force the host to open the XMPP connection to.

## Running locally

To run locally on OSX or Linux you'll need to set the required environment variables and run the `bin/hubot` script. An example script to run the bot might look like:

    #!/bin/bash
    
    export HUBOT_HIPCHAT_JID="..."
    export HUBOT_HIPCHAT_NAME="..."
    export HUBOT_HIPCHAT_PASSWORD="..."
    
    ~/hubot/bin/hubot -a hipchat -n Hubot

### OSX note

This adapter requires `node-stringprep` which in turn, requires `icu-config` to be available in the path. You'll need to install `icu4c`, which, conveniently, homebrew can take care of for you:

    % brew install icu4c

But `brew` will not link any of the utilities, you'll have to do that by hand (in particular `icu-config` which is needed for `node-stringprep` to build correctly (it'll just appear like a broken package otherwise which will be really disturbing)). You can link it with brew using `brew link icu4c`.
